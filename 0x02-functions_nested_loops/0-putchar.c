Here is the C code that prints `_putchar` followed by a new line and returns 0:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("_putchar\n");
    return 0;
}
```

When you run this code, it will output `_putchar` followed by a new line. The `return 0` statement indicates that the program has executed successfully.
